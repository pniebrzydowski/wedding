## Accommodations

Grein is a small, but touristy town directly along the Danube. Therefore, the number of available accommodations during the summer can be quite limited, and we highly recommend booking accommodation as soon as possible!

To help with this, we have reserved a block of rooms for Friday and Saturday nights in the following hotels nearby. You can book directly through the hotel, but **please be sure to indicate in the booking request that you are a part of the wedding**. Unless otherwise noted, double rooms contain one double (king-size) bed, single rooms one twin bed, and family rooms have one double (king-size) bed and two twin beds. Breakfast is included at all the hotels listed below.

Nothing is finalized at this point, but we intend to arrange a shuttle for transportation after the wedding (midnight - 4am) back to the various hotels in the area.
