## Accommodation

Grein is a small, but touristy town directly along the Danube. Therefore, the number of available accommodations during the summer can be quite limited, and we highly recommend booking accommodation as soon as possible!

To help with this, we have reserved a block of rooms in th following hotels nearby. You can book directly through the hotel, but please be sure to indicate in the booking request that you are a part of wedding.

Nothing is finalized at this point, but we are also looking to arrange a shuttle for transportation after the wedding back to the various hotels in the area.
