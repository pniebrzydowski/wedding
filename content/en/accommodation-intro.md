## Accommodations

Grein is a small, but touristy town directly along the Danube. Therefore, the number of available accommodations during the summer can be quite limited, and we highly recommend booking accommodation as soon as possible!

Unless otherwise noted, double rooms contain one double (king-size) bed, single rooms one twin bed, and family rooms have one double (king-size) bed and two twin beds. Breakfast is included at all the hotels listed below.

We have arranged a **shuttle** for transportation after the wedding (midnight - 4am) back to the various hotels in the area.
