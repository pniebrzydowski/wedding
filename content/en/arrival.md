## How to get there

The closest large city is Linz, the capital of Upper Austria. It is easily accessible via all forms of transportation, and lies about halfway between Christina's hometown of Schardenberg and our current home in Vienna. Connections to the town are generally good, but as it is not a major city, routes may not always be quick or direct.

If you are flying in, the simplest airport option is likely Vienna (VIE). The closest airport would be Linz (LNZ), though connections there are limited, especially from overseas.

If flying from overseas, you may also want to consider Munich (MUC), Budapest (BUD), or Prague (PRG), as flights to Vienna are often pricier. If renting a car all of these are similar distances from Grein, but Munich generally has better train connections. Also, there should likely be no language barrier in any of the locations, but it may be a bit less of a problem in Munich than in Prague or Budapest.
