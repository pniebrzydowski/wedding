## Christina Wallner

Despite being an introvert, Christina is often the life of the party and finds friends everywhere she goes. She enjoys sitting on the beach or the couch with a good book, and also likes spending her free time painting, knitting, or doing puzzles. 

Growing up on a farm in the Innviertel region of Upper Austria near the border to Bavaria, she developed a love for animals, and she certainly never expected to end up in Vienna. Now, she is working full-time in the payroll department of a tax office in the big city, while also studying law remotely at Johannes Kepler University in Linz.

Music has always been an important part of her life. Since she was young, she has played and when she is still plays clarinet in the Trachtenmusikkapelle Schardenberg. During her time in university in Linz, she also played with the JKU Blasorchester.
