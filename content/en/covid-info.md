## Covid-19 Update

To provide a safer environment, as well as abide by local restrictions in Austria, **everyone will be required to present proof of compliance with the "3G" rule before entering the castle**. This means you will need to have proof of one of the following:

- Vaccinated (at least 2 weeks after your second shot)
- Recently Recovered (within the last 6 months)
- Tested (PCR test within 72 hours, or Antigen Test within 48 hours)

Please have this ready when you arrive to ease the process. This control will help us to ensure a safer environment so that we can all focus on having a good time! Thank you for your understanding and we can't wait to celebrate with you all. 

If you are not vaccinated or recently recovered, here is some <a href="https://www.austria.info/en/service-and-facts/coronavirus-information/tests">information about testing in Austria</a>. If you have not already done so, we highly recommend getting one of the Covid-19 vaccinations prior to the wedding. We will take precautions where possible to keep everyone safe and healthy, but the best way to protect yourself from potentially serious effects of the virus is through vaccination.
