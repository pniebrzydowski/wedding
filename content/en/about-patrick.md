## Patrick Niebrzydowski

Patrick is the definition of an extrovert. He loves being around people as well as seeking new experiences, especially different varieties of food and drinks. His free time is often spent planning trips, which he may or may not take, learning new languages, or watching sports (Go Green!).

Raised in suburban Detroit, he once told his family he never saw much reason to leave his immediate surroundings. Now, he's been living in Austria for five years and has traveled to dozens of countries around the world. 

Before moving to Austria, he earned bachelors degrees at Michigan State University in Advertising and Telecommunication, Information Studies and Media and worked a few years as a Web developer in Ann Arbor and Detroit. Later, he earned a masters degree in Interactive Media at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria in Hagenberg and is now working in Vienna as a frontend developer in the travel industry.
