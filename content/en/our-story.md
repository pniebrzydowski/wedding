title: "Our Story"

### The Beginning

We first met in July 2017 at a birthday party Christina organized in the basement bar of the dorm Patrick was living in at the time. We would see each other from time to time at various parties and always enjoyed it, but romance wasn't in the picture. Looking back, the first sign of how well we fit together was during a group ski trip to Kaprun, when the two of us enjoyed a 90s dance party until late into the early morning after everyone else had already gone to bed.

### Coming Together

We became a couple during the Passau Maidult festival, on May 5th, 2018. The picture on our wedding invitation, believe it or not, was taken a few moments before we shared our first kiss. In the same night, Patrick stubbornly challenged Christina to a chugging race, and embarrassed himself as you can see in the photo.

### Building a Relationship

Over the next few months, our relationship grew. We took a weekend trip to Trieste in Italy and learned that we can make the best of anything, as long as we are together. Our planned beach day was interrupted by a rain shower, but we still had a blast, turning the back of the car into a picnic area and playing cards. 

In September 2018, Patrick was laid off from his job in Linz. Shortly thereafter, he found a wonderful job opportunity working in the travel industry. Christina showed incredible support, and did something she never expected to do in her life&#8212;move to Vienna.

### Falling in Love

In the meantime, we took our first extended trip together, spending about 10 days in Thailand. We again discovered our ability to adjust to adversity, surviving a 4-hour flight delay followed by a convenience store dinner, and dealing with a hospital visit after Christina was hit by a motorbike. 

Despite these challenges, the trip was a wonderful experience which exibited our connection. While enjoying a peaceful late-night swim in the warm ocean, Christina said "I love you" for the first time and Patrick responded enthusiastically with an invitation to visit his family a few months later in the USA over Christmas.

### The Engagement

Due to the pandemic and lockdowns, ring shopping and planning a proposal was not easy. However, in September 2020, we took a short trip to the Salzkammergut region of Austria. After an incredible dinner at a local restaurant, Patrick proposed on the balcony of the accommodation, overlooking the beautiful Attersee. The next day, we conquered our first challenge as an engaged couple, summitting the Almkogel together.
