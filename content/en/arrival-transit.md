The castle is reachable via the nearest train station, Grein Stadt Bahnhof, which lies about 9 minutes away by foot.

Bus routes generally arrive at Grein Schiffstation (Donaulände), which is approximately 10 minutes walking from the castle.

#### From Passau or Schärding

#### Saving on Transit tickets

Before buying a ticket, consider grouping together and utilizing the the <a href="https://www.oebb.at/de/tickets-kundenkarten/schueler-gruppen/einfach-raus-ticket" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Einfach-Raus Ticket</a>. The ticket is only valid on local trains (R-, CJX, REX, and S-Bahn) and not express trains (ICE, Railjet). When travelling with a group of 5, the price is only 47€ valid for one calendar day (as compared to €68,50 for 5 individual tickets from Linz, or around 200€ from Vienna).

If you are arriving at the Munich airport, it is almost always best to purchase a <a href="https://www.bahn.com/en/view/offers/regional/regional-day-ticket-for-bavaria.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bayern Ticket</a>. These tickets are similar to the Einfach-Raus Ticket in Austria, in that they are only available for use on local trains. However, even the cost for a single person (25€) is often lower than the cost to get from Munich to Austria. Most likely, the best route will be via a local train to Passau or Salzburg, while purchasing a separate ticket for the Austrian portion of the journey. They can be purchased online or at the airport DB ticket vending machines.

For both of these regional discount tickets, be sure to write your name on the ticket before departing on your journey!
