We take the pandemic very seriously and our first priority is the safety and health of all our guests. We will follow any requirements and recommendations and take all necessary precautions.

As of now, the wedding can take place unrestricted, with the exception of a requirement for entry. For this, all guests must be either vaccinated, recently recovered, or tested. Please see <a href="/home">the homepage</a> for the latest information.
