title: "Can I bring my kids?"
order: 5

We do love all of you and would love to celebrate with as many people as possible. However, as space is limited and the castle is not exactly a playground, we ask that you enjoy your evening out without the kids.

Thank you for your understanding!

We also look forward to a second celebration in Michigan in the future, where the whole family is welcome!
