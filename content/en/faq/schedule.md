To help you better know what to expect, below is a tentative schedule of how the day will progress.

### 13:00 - Reception

As you arrive, you will be greeted with a small selection of refreshing drinks, including beers from <a href="https://wenzl-privatbraeu.jimdosite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Wenzl</a>, a small private brewery in the family, which was recently named "Brewery of the Year 2021" in Austria by the esteemed Gault & Millau.

### 14:00 - Wedding Ceremony

The wedding ceremony, including a liturgy of the word, will take place inside the Rittersaal and the adjacent Chapel.

### 15:00 - Cocktail Hour

Immediately following the ceremony, we will proceed downstairs into the beautiful courtyard for a cocktail hour with refreshing drinks and appetizers, accompanied by music from members of Christina's band - <a href="http://www.trachtenmusikkapelleschardenberg.at/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Trachtenmusikkapelle Schardenberg</a>. During this time, we will also be taking group photographs.

### 18:00 - Opening of Buffet

Around 17:00, we will conclude the cocktail hour and begin moving back into the Rittersaal for dinner and an evening of fun. Seating will be arranged by table, but there will be no assigned seats within the table. This may change, depending on the Corona regulations at the time. After everyone has had time to find their seats and get comfortable, the dinner buffet will open around 18:00. Vegetarian options will be included. If you have any special dietary needs, please include them in your reply, or reach out to us directly!

An open bar will be available throughout the night, and <a href="https://www.duorotation.at/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Duo Rotation</a> will be providing the entertainment after dinner.

### 11:30 - Midnight Snack

For a proper full night of partying, we think it's important to make sure everyone is properly fueled throughout the night. A small but hearty snack will be provided around midnight to keep everyone going.

### Closing Time

Though we do not have an official closing time, the cleaning crew will arrive at 06:00 and we will need to start packing up around 03:00.
