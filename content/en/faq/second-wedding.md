We look forward to celebrating with friends and family from all over the world. One of the important aspects of a wedding for us is bringing all of our loved ones together and we hope that as many of you as possible will be able to attend!

However, with such an international circle, we also understand that it may not be so easy for all to find the time and ability to make an extended journey.

As a result, we do intend to have a less formal celebration in the Detroit area. We have no specific plan yet, but tentatively it will take place sometime in late June or early July of 2022. In this celebration, we are happy to welcome your entire families! We encourage those of our guests from outside the USA to join us for this celebration as well.
