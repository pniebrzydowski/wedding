We are confident that most dietary restrictions should be covered by our offerings. A variety of hors d'oeuvres during the cocktail hour, main courses, side dishes, and salads in the buffet, as well as dessert options will be available, including multiple vegetarian options throughout.

Drinks will be provided via an open bar throughout the day. Various non-alcoholic beverages; beer; red, white, and sparling wine; and a selection of spirits will be available.

If you have any specific additional restrictions, please let us know in the reply form. We will do our best to accommodate all special requests where possible. If you have any concerns, please contact us directly!
