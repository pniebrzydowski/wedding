title: "Where are the hot spots in Grein on a Friday night?"
---

With many of guests coming in from out of town and all over Austria and a relatively early start time, we expect (and recommend) that many of you plan to spend Friday night before the wedding in Grein. We will provide more details later, but we intent to host a small gathering on Friday night somewhere in town so that we can spend a bit more quality time with you, and you all can visit with old friends and meet new ones.
