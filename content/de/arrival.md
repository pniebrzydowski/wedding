## How to get there

Schloss Greinburg is located in Grein, just inside Upper Austria along the Danube. The closest large city is Linz, the capital of Upper Austria. It is easily accessible via all forms of transportation, and lies about halfway between Christina's hometown of Schardenberg and our current home in Vienna. Connections to the town are generally good, but as it is not a major city, routes may not always be quick or direct.

### By Car

#### From Linz

Grein can be reached in about 45 minutes via route B3, or via the A1 highway to Route B119 and later B3 via the Amstetten West exit.

#### From Vienna

Grein can be reached in about 1 hour and 35 minutes via the A1 highway to Route B25 and later B3 via the Ybbs exit.

#### From Schardenberg or Passau

Grein can be reached in about 1 hour and 50 minutes entering the A3 highway in Passau or A8 highway in Suben, followed by the A25 and A1, continuing along Route B119 and later B3 via the Amstetten West exit.

### By Public Transit

The castle is reachable via the nearest train station, Grein Stadt Bahnhof, which lies about 9 minutes away by foot. For the most up to date transit information, see the [Austrian Federal Railway](https://tickets.oebb.at/en/ticket) for the latest timetables and ticket purchases. Bus routes generally arrive at Grein Schiffstation (Donaulände), which is approximately 10 minutes walking from the castle.

##### Saving on Transit tickets

Before buying a ticket, consider grouping together and utilizing the the [Einfach-Raus Ticket](https://www.oebb.at/en/tickets-kundenkarten/schueler-gruppen/einfach-raus-ticket). The ticket is only valid on local trains (R-, CJX, REX, and S-Bahn) and not express trains (ICE, Railjet). When travelling with a group of 5, the price is only 47€ valid for one calendar day (as compared to €68,50 for 5 individual tickets from Linz, or around 200€ from Vienna).

If you are arriving at the Munich airport, it is almost always best to purchase a [Bayern Ticket](https://www.bahn.com/en/view/offers/regional/regional-day-ticket-for-bavaria.shtml). These tickets are similar to the Einfach-Raus ticket in Austria, in that they are only available for use on local trains. However, even the cost for a single person (25€) is often lower than the cost to get from Munich to Austria. Most likely, the best route will be via a local train to Passau or Salzburg, while purchasing a separate ticket for the Austrian portion of the journey. They can be purchased online or at the airport DB ticket vending machines.

For both of these regional discount tickets, be sure to write your name on the ticket before departing on your journey!

#### From Linz

Connections are available from the Linz Main Station regularly, and require about 75 to 90 minutes, depending on transfers. With a standard ticket as of February 7, the price for this route is €13,70.

#### From Vienna

Connections from Vienna require about 2 to 3 hours and 1 or 2 transfers, either by train or bus. The standard ticket from Vienna runs €41,50. "Sparschiene" tickets may be available when purchased long enough in advance, reducing the cost to as low as €9,90.

#### From Passau or Schärding

Connections from Passau or Schärding take about 3 to 3.5 hours via 1-3 transfers. The standard cost of the ticket is €19,40. Look for "Sparschiene" tickets in advance to reduce the cost to as low as €9,90. Some of these connections are via local trains, so the Einfach-Raus ticket may also be an option here.
