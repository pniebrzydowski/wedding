title: "What about Covid?"
---

We take the pandemic very seriously and our first priority is the safety and health of all our guests. We will follow any requirements and recommendations and take all necessary precautions. However, we are optimistic due to the increasing pace of vaccinations, especially in the USA, as well as the improving weather conditions.

There is unfortunately a lot of uncertainty in these times. We are hopeful, but there is of course still the possibility that the wedding will need to be postponed to a later date. Please keep this in mind when making your travel plans. We will be sure to inform all our guests as soon as any new information is available.
